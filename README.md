This repository contains several contents about Chatting System Web-Based Application, such as diagram, source code, and demo link.

I uploaded the source code in this repository and I will share with you the links you can access below:
  1. Diagram for a chatting system supports both group and single chat.
  2. Entity-Relationship Diagram for chatting system database structure.
  3. Chat interface with a responsive view (web and mobile) demo link.


  Create a diagram for a chatting system that supports both group and single chat.
Create a database structure for point (1) above using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
Using the dummy JSON response below as the conversation data (﻿https://bit.ly/chat_room_endpoint﻿), create a chat interface with a responsive view (web and mobile). Attach your answer as files used or deploy to a location where we can evaluate it.
Extend the JSON format (payload) to display other message types containing images, videos, or PDFs. Upload or attach the .json file as part of your answer.
Develop the chat page interface to display messages containing images, videos, or PDFs. Use the .json file created in the previous step as the conversation data.
